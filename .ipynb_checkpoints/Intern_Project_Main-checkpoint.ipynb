always wearing goofy ass costume due gear little interaction mc students minigames play either mc complete teachers pet regardless want character like aspect makes sense students ignore zero consequences actions whatever want story set stone fail anything either use unforgivable curses much want nobody give shit progression game also horrible around third way game unlock ability unlock locks unlock tier exploring able unlock tier locks waste time backtrack get one tier lock gearing really matter smack whatever highest stats even need upgrade gear ever thing gearing really make look like clown fashion system change appearance look like clown resets whenever equip new gear might well stay clown game tells start unlocking talent points level unlock single talent well level talent points mostly useless due combat extremely easy good talent increasing revelio range spamming revelio constantly entire playthrough open world offers nothing interesting ton merlin chores increase gear slots none offer kind challenge usually enjoy platforming merlin chore platforming trial consists jumping one massive block another right next impossible fail incredibly boring also bunch caves treasure vaults time follows run passage loot chest good job cleared cave time actually open cave treasure vault way long least one active brain cell doable extremely rare ocassions something cave get one chest long one brain cell still active manage even rarer occassions might encounter enemy cave omg destroy second challenge activities open world like pop balloons row broom engaging fun even landing platforms land combat dreadfully easy playing cheats aimbot turned probably developed consoles aim normally game zooms back head covers half screen lock targeting system pc garbage way switch targets arrow keys never lock enemy aimbot anyway enemy never dodges spells either feel free massacre enemy ai really bad well makes easy game even easier best example dugbogs routinely gets stuck means spam without even moving however game get praise related mechanics different enemy types like use flipendo club troll swung flip face kinds things kept combat completely boring secrets puzzles game challenging part example one hogwarts secrets light braziers bridge match symbols whoever charge designing puzzles must designing toddlers however give praise one single thing related puzzles depulso puzzle rooms fun puzzles game albeit bit short far best part game room requirement appeal people like making houses sims room requirement also vivariums unlocked story progression hold beasts capture game also get bonus good shiny rates beasts think many would wanted pokemon levels shiny rates beasts game quidditch game understandable instead replaced broom races challenge arrogant asshole named imelda beat times describe easy beat start race go make dinner eat dinner take shit come back still faster supposed fastest racer hogwarts leaving dust check leaderboards race nowhere found leaderboard times difficult beat either disappointing hoping broom races spoilers ahead common story set stone none choices impact whatsoever towards end story two main antagonists falling one confronts offer work together take main antagonists personally would liked able accept offer instead mc dumb wants kill instead technically two endings extremely similar ending decided drum roll dialogue options final boss fight nothing really matters extremely evident throughout game characters also really shallow really interact much characters want play game set harry potter universe
