       "'Greattt Game!9/10Fantastic experience. A true Wizarding World experience. Play it and experience it, the castle alone is the worth it. And thats only a third of the game.worth itI\\'ve been waiting 84 YEARSSSSSSSS.The game is everything I could have hoped for and more.very fun game (it is not transphobic at all)Better than expected! But bad optimization.GarbageFull of surprises!Fun Harry Potter Game! My sister and I Enjoyed it.One of the best games I have bought in my recent memoryDenuvo Anti-Tampering makes the game stutter, same as every other game that adopts this cancer.very funI have awaited this game for a over a decade, and I wasn\\'t disappointed. Quite an achievement.The best game of the yearVery aesthetically made gameLove the game! I needed to upgrade my graphics card and more RAM, but now that I\\'m all set up, it\\'s great!Excellent gameGreat game. Love all the little details to make this game come aliveI no watch harry potter movies but being wizard fun. Good game. Make DLC7/10 - my immersion is somewhat broken by the fact that 18th century Scotland school has 90% of the professors and more than half of the students with foreign accent. How many are there in the movies? And that\\'s 20th centuryAfter a long time I\\'ve spent so much time on a Single-Player Game. I am seriously hooked on it. I am looking forward to further content for this game.it looks amazingI love this game, despite completing the story there is tons more to do :) Secretly hoping that, at a later date, there will be further progression where you becoming a working member of the ministry with new stories/missions :)The visuals in the game are stunning.  There are numerous character customization options.  I play on a PC and don\\'t recommend using a keyboard if you have a controller.awesome game 10/10HOGWARTS + RPG = EXCELLENTthere were major performance issues to start with, but they seem to have been mostly fixed. Overall a great AAA game!Game is a blast whether you liked HP or not. Choice is an illusion as all outcomes are predetermined and the story isn\\'t spectacular but the other aspects of the game more than make up for it. Solid 9/10Game of the decadeGot to borrow the game, 100% lived up to the hype I had for it! Would recommend if you have the money and enjoy a good harry potter experienceHogwarts Legacy is a very mediocre, generic and formulaic modern open world game that\\'s saved from being a bad game by the Harry Potter license. They\\'ve done a good job of recreating Hogwarts and it is honestly really cool being able to fly around and above the castle on your broom seamlessly. I had fun in my first several hours playing the game just exploring the castle and the areas outside around the castle like hogsmeade. The more you progress though the more you realise how little the game has to offer. One of the biggest offenders is how lifeless the world feels with the lack of interaction in general. I compare it to Bully which came out 17 years ago now. When you walk around the school in Bully it feels like you are a part of that world. There is a time mechanic where you need to get to class on time and go to bed on time etc. All the NPC\\'s have their routine they\\'re following making you feel like the world is moving regardless of you being there rather than it feeling like the world is waiting for you like it does in Hogwarts Legacy. The difference between the level of interaction compared to a game released in 2006 is honestly really sad but that\\'s just one of my many complaints. The general lack of role playing is also a big issue, you don\\'t feel like a student in this world at all. You go to class like less than a dozen times from what i recall just to learn spells so you can go on mass killings in the world. The story and writing in general is lackluster, lack of well written characters to latch on to and connect with to pull you through the story. Main character has no personality. No consequences for your actions and choices have zero impact on the outcome in the end. Combat gets extremely repetitive and tiresome. The R2/RT spam is ridiculous i felt like i was on autopilot throughout most of the combat. The lack of enemy variety didn\\'t help either. The gear system is terrible because of the level scaling making exploration pointless knowing you will never find a really good item that will last you dozens of hours because everything is scaled to your level. There is nothing interesting to see outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade because of all the bland check list side activities they\\'ve added to pad out the length. Boring level and puzzle design in the caves and dungeons. UI feels like it\\'s ripped straight out of a modern Ubisoft game. Graphics are inconsistent, sometimes it looks like a good looking PS4 game and other times it looks like an early PS3 game. The performance is awful because of the amount of VRAM it uses, i had to find a fix online for my RTX 3070 8gb because it ate all my VRAM like it was nothing. Maybe it\\'s justified if the game looked amazing but it doesn\\'t. The game overall doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s a full price Triple A game, it feels like a budget title. Makes sense that the developers last game was Cars 3. 4/10 (Mediocre)I am in love with this game! There is so much to see, do and explore! The graphics are amazing even though there were some glitches in Hogsmeade but they seem to have been resolved. Amazing game over all so far.Most fun i\\'ve had in a game for years - and I\\'m not even a Potter fan.no complaints. This is how you make a Harry Potter game!fucking amazingLoved itAmazing \"open\" magic world, the main story is a little shorter than expected. They can be a lots of other new features, but it is a must for any Wizarding World fan and for the non-fan too, it a nice and different game.Great so far minus combat. This is dogshitAmazing gamebest game everTedious, slow, presumptuous, patronising and dull.Im only about an hour into the game but it is a blast and i highly recommend this to anyone who has watch or is into harry potter and to those who may not be into it.the game we have wanted for yearsGreat game !Very Good so farLiving out all my childhood dreams!long but good (that\\'s what she said)SOOO GOOOOOODsuraj chanda makkhan khalo , is gye gujre ka rang badal daloAmazing!This game is amazing, from the gameplay, cut scenes, fighting systems, graphics to how they are so inclusive and even add in LGBTQ characters.i need the new dlcvery good game i can pet cats and stuffbest game this Year yetI am the most evil Hufflepuff known to man I am worse than Voldemort even. I\\'m so silly for using Avada Kedavra!Gameplay is super fun and story is interesting enough to keep going. Very \"light\" though, nothing to deep, really predictable.No morality system is kind of strange though..using dark arts should be punished somehow. This destroys the immersion for me.This game makes you really feel like a wizard, it has a little something for everyone, too much water 5/7.good gameAbsolutely fantastic game....Huge open world tons to do great story line.....Has a few bugs that need to be fixed like optimization issues....but overall great game.....AVADA KEDAVRA!50 hours in, and its amazing.Have really enjoyed my time as a wizardGame is fun, has performance issues but outside of that the game is pretty solid.if you want the same vibe as the original trilogy on the pc this is the game for you. also it runs better then i expected on my pc.games\\'s awsome buy itFantastic game! 10/10 would recommend for any potter fan out there. Ignore all the bs hate from idiots.I love this game. I\\'m not much of a fighter, so I play Easy mode, but it is so much to explore. The Hogwarts castle is magnificent and there are so many puzzles and things to find. And the magic is great.Brilliant. Some stuttering but not game breaking. Very enjoyableVroom, Vroom, Skirrrttt!Just a seriously well made game.It is everything I\\'ve ever wanted in a wizarding world game!!!! I hope they come out with expansions!!!Cool storyline and great paintingsGreat game!Professor Garlick. Need I say more?please fix stuttering and FPS drop my pc system have above requirement but can\\'t play this game with 60 fpsIt\\'s like Assassin\\'s Creed with wizardsyeah, its pretty cool gamegot in to a spiders cave and fell from a cliff, now my entire game got stuck mid air. It acts like i am with the mouse on an image, no reaction, I\\'ve hit all the buttons from my keyboard to get a move.From a to z and f1 to f12 not a single button got me unstuck.I am currently removing the game. Hoping uninstall/install will solve the issue.Forget petting.. you can levitate and shoot every Cat in this gamejust play it and stop reading commentsall it does is crash.i try optimizing my settings, crashes.i try reinstalling, crashes.i try verifying files, crashes.turn off ray tracing, crashes.turn off other options, crashes.reduce from ultra to low, crashes.my recommended settings are ultra everything and everything on. my pc can play it, but the game just crashes.i play 2 minutes, crashes.i play 10 minutes, crashes.crashes, crashes, crashes.will update with recommend if the game gets fixed so i\\'m not crashing every time i try to play.very fun game with a beautiful interactive world with lots of secrets!good soupThe game is amazingLatest update added lag to the gameAwful stuttering, borderline unplayable until fixed. Will remove review when this eventually happensRTX 3060, Ryzan 7 5700G, 16GB DDR4 ramDeek thinks you should be proud of all the potions you’ve brewed!you aint gotta read or watch nothin to enjoy this gameamazing story amazing game 5/5 definetly game of the yearSuper fun gamebest game since the witcher 3good game!A very pretty game but shallow in executionits greatPerformance is horrible, optimization was clearly not on the minds of the developers, a shame. Everything about this game is wonderful but just given the performance I cannot in good faith recommend this product. Refunded. Buy it on a console if you have the next-gen hardware, it\\'s gonna save you a ton of headaches, mods aren\\'t worth it here.Awesome for someone with ADDGood GameIt\\'s like dream come true.NOT!! a very big fan of Harry Potter but have played older games and have always wondered how it would fell to have an open world game of it.It\\'s an entirely different experience it\\'s open world like other games but MAGICAL!!Very good game!!Good contender for GOTY. Very addictive, and nastalgic. Worth the buyMassive performance issue, needs patch - frequent fps drop to single digits and 20s. Good game otherwiseBeautiful large world with so much detail, lots of fun and totally worth it!Hear me out ... Avada Kedavra!Leviosa. Not leVioSA ...no sex spellGame of the year! God bless JK for this amazing universe and WB team for this awesome game.this game lives up to the hypeAvada Kedavragreat game I am hookaddictiveSlytherin ON TOPPP If it ain\\'t Slytherin put a K behind itJUST GOOD INNITwizards broi\\'m magik me likeAbsolutely astounding!magic goodLets start with the pros:- Hogwarts itself looks great, at times I felt like I was in a Harry Potter movie- Music is decent, they remixed the classic HP tunes- Graphics are decent to great- Voice acting is pretty goodBut unfortunately once you look past the surface, a lot of problems start to appear. Unless youre a blind fanboy. One of the biggest issue if not the biggest is the empty open world littered with completely pointless stuff like Merlin\\'s Trials, Treasure Vaults etc. Stuff straight out of Ubisoft\\'s book for \"How to Pad Your Game\\'s Length\".It would be alright if for example the Merlin\\'s Trials were like 8 trials total, all wildly different. Merlin\\'s Trials are simple puzzles you have to complete in droves to unlock more of your very limited inventory space. After you\\'ve done 3 different Trials, you\\'ve done them all. Unfortunately there are over 90 of these goddamn trials.Treasure Vaults are like Merlin\\'s Trials but even simpler and and the reward is opening a door in to a tiny \"dungeon\" (and I mean tiny, takes 5 seconds to reach the loot) where one piece of loot awaits you, usually just something trash (its all randomized so you can even savescum before opening any container)And there\\'s tons of these, just littered everywhere. And you cant turn them off. When youre flying on your broom and press R to reveal nearby interesting locations, a huge mass of these icons pops up in your face and you just want to quit playing.Side quests are nearly all simple fetch quests, some dont even bother hiding it. I just currently got a literal fetch quest where I have to make a delivery in a far away place. I know I wont finish this quest.There are over 150 so called \"field guide pages\" to collect in Hogwarts alone. These net you XP which is needed to level up. 90% of the content in this game is Ubisoft style completely pointless garbage. And I really mean around 90%. 5% is fetch quests and actual good content is the remaining 5%, the main quests which are actually fun to play.Forget about anything interesting happening anywhere, the NPC\\'s are all just as soulless as for example in Cyberpunk. There is no AI whatsoever. Forget even about stuff like for example in Witcher 3, where even small bandit hideout location often had a bit of attached lore in the form of a diary of their latest victim etc, just fleshing out the world. None of that here.I\\'m 17 hours in and I just have no interest playing anymore, its very formulaic, very tiresome, and apart from the occasional fun main questing, overwhelming majority of the content is braindead boring. And I didn\\'t even mention the performance issues. They can fix the performance but they wont fix the game design choices made.Great game, badly optimized for PC though, may get better in the futureamazing and absolutely astonishingcracking open world gameiz veery niiiceits coolI\\'m a frickin\\' wizard! pew! pew! pew!Fly the broom, do the magic,Good gameive been personally victimized by the merlin trialsIts SO much fun! Don\\'t let other people stop you from playing this if you want to. In todays world its not possible to be morally perfect in every decision you make. So buy the game, and be the witch or wizard you were always meant to be.Great game with so many puzzles and secrets. Great way to realize a childhood dream.me: experiences the slightest inconvenience also me: \"AVADA KEDAVRA!\"I think i\\'m starting to like magic - 10/10Combat feels very satisfying.World is very neat and detailed, but does not feel immersive.barry botterIt\\'s like a childhood dream come true! A free roam Hogwarts Experience is just what I wished for.. And the graphics are surreal.LOVE the game can\\'t wait to see what else they may add later on!LET ME OPEN THE GOD DAMN GAMEendless stuttering, and what the fuck is this ram usageAvada Kedavra!!!Everything I neededGood game, no matter what people think they feel about it.You can pet the catsQuit running away and let me rescue you with my kid napping sackAmazing game. Can spend hours in it.The amount of effort and dedication the developers put into this game is astounding. This is the definition of what the gaming community needs. Games you can play over and over again... NOT the same game you can purchase over and over again.game is a lot of fun best i played in a whileSo magicalAmazing game so far, so much to do, if only they\\'d included a bit of co-op, Qudditch and Wizards Chess it could be a contender for GOTY. excited for future DLC!doubles as a horse riding simulatorit very good为数不多全价直接购买的游戏了。算是哈利波特半个书迷/影迷。故事性不错，风景也很不错。目前看来可探索的区域和分支剧情也有很多，完全够值回票价。Amazing game and a must play! People are down-voting because of Rowling, but nobody that has played this game can deny that it\\'s great!Из плюсов: красивая, динамичная боевка.В целом паразитирующая на вселенной и именах консольная душнина с мертвым миром, безальтернативными квестами и скучнейшими персонажами.great rpgThe game is worth to buyjust finished the story in about 25 hours and still have a ton of content to play. currently writing this review after an 8 hour session. i bought the game impulsively and i do not regret it. great game.Super Game aber bin zu Nett um Böse zu sein :cAs a transgender this game is very offensive.\"Merlin\\'s Beard\"Hogwarts Legacy will be the most overhyped and also the most boring game of the year.The immersion and role playing elements are absolute trash, I never once felt like a student as hogwarts as I was always wearing some goofy ass costume due to my gear. There is little to no interaction between mc and the other students and there are no minigames to play with them either. MC is a complete teachers pet regardless of what you want your character to be like and in that aspect it makes sense that the other students ignore you. There are zero consequences for your actions, so you can\\'t be whatever you want to be as the story is set in stone, you can\\'t fail anything either. You can use unforgivable curses as much as you want and nobody will give a shit.The progression in the game is also horrible. Around a third of the way into the game you unlock the ability to unlock locks and what you unlock is tier 1 of 3. Exploring before being able to unlock tier 3 locks is a waste of time as you\\'d have to backtrack just to get that one tier 3 lock. Gearing doesn\\'t really matter at all and you just smack on whatever has the highest stats, you don\\'t even need to upgrade any gear ever, the only thing gearing really does is make you look like a clown. There is a fashion system so you can change appearance to not look like a clown, but it resets whenever you equip new gear, so you might as well just stay as a clown. The game tells you that you start unlocking talent points from level 5, but you can\\'t unlock a single talent before you\\'re well over level 10. The talent points themselves are mostly useless due to the combat being extremely easy and the only good talent is increasing revelio range as you\\'re spamming revelio constantly during your entire playthrough.The open world offers nothing interesting to do. There are a ton of merlin chores to increase your gear slots, but none of these offer any kind of challenge. I usually enjoy platforming, but the merlin chore platforming trial consists of jumping from one massive block to another that is right next to the other, they are impossible to fail. It\\'s just so incredibly boring. There are also a bunch of caves and treasure vaults, but most of the time they are as follows; run down a passage and loot 1 chest. Good job you\\'ve cleared a cave. Some time you actually have to open the cave or treasure vault in some way, but as long as you have at least one active brain cell this is very doable. On extremely rare ocassions there is something you have to do in the cave to get your one chest, but as long as that one brain cell is still active you\\'ll manage. On even rarer occassions you might encounter an enemy in a cave (OMG) which you\\'ll destroy in a second, what a challenge. There are some other activities in the open world like you can pop 5 balloons in a row on your broom, this is so engaging and fun. There are even landing platforms you can land on and that\\'s about it. The combat is dreadfully easy, you are playing with cheats as your aimbot is turned on probably as it was developed for consoles. You can aim normally, but then the game zooms in so the back of your head covers half the screen. The lock-on targeting system for PC is garbage as the way you switch targets is with the arrow keys, so never lock-on to an enemy, you have aimbot anyway. The enemy never dodges any of your spells either so feel free to massacre them. The enemy AI is really bad as well which makes an easy game even easier, the best example are the dugbogs which routinely gets stuck which means you can spam them down without them even moving. However the game should get some praise now and this is related to some mechanics of different enemy types like how you can use flipendo on the club of a troll after it has swung at you to flip it into its face, these kinds of things kept the combat from being completely boring. The secrets and puzzles of this game were not challenging at all for the most part. For example one of the hogwarts secrets are light 4 braziers on a bridge and then match the symbols. Whoever was in charge of designing the puzzles must have been designing this for toddlers. However I will give praise to one single thing related to puzzles and that is the depulso puzzle rooms as they were the only fun puzzles to do in this game albeit a bit short. The by far best part of this game is the room of requirement which will appeal to people that like making houses in the sims. The room of requirement also have up to 4 vivariums unlocked through story progression which can hold the beasts you capture. The game should also get a bonus for having very good shiny rates for the beasts as I don\\'t think many would have wanted Pokemon levels of shiny rates for the beasts in this game.There\\'s no quidditch in this game which is understandable, but instead it was replaced with broom races. You are challenge by some arrogant asshole named Imelda to beat her times. To describe how easy she is to beat, you can start the race, then go make dinner, eat your dinner, take a shit and then come back to still be faster than her. She is supposed to be the fastest racer at Hogwarts, but after leaving her in the dust you can check the leaderboards for the race and she\\'s nowhere to be found. The leaderboard times are not very difficult to beat either which is disappointing. I was hoping there was more broom races, but there are only 3.-Spoilers ahead-As is very common now the story is set in stone, none of your choices have any impact whatsoever. Towards the end of the story two of the main antagonists have a falling out and one of these confronts you and offer you to work together with him to take down the main antagonists. Personally I would have liked to be able to accept this offer, but instead MC is dumb and wants to kill him instead. There are technically two endings, but they are extremely similar and the ending is decided by drum roll... dialogue options before final boss fight. Nothing really matters and that is extremely evident throughout the game. The characters are also really shallow, but then again we don\\'t really interact much with any of the characters.If you want to play a game set in the Harry Potter universe I\\'d rather recommend the older Harry Potter games as they are far more engaging and challenging.it is a very good gameI thought being single player would push me away, but I ended up loving this game. The graphics are amazing, the storyline is so interesting. The game pulls you in and excites the player. 10/10 recommend.To be clear, I\\'m not leaving a negative review because of the recent controversy. I couldn\\'t give a damn about JK Rowling\\'s opinions or how others have chosen to interpret them.In truth, I want to recommend this game. I want to recommend it so much, just for its merits in gameplay and design, but I can\\'t. I can\\'t because the game is sadly suffering from poor optimisations and serious stuttering. I know its not cutting-edge hardware, but an RTX 3080 should be able to handle it on high settings at the very least, yet I have to tone the settings to mostly medium just to get a playable framerate.What really drives the point home is that this game actually runs better on the steam deck. Some are blaming Denuvo DRM for the poor performance, but until the game runs smoothly (whether it be because Denuvo is patched out of the game or the game is optimised to run smoothly even with Denuvo attached), this is where my review will end.A dream come trueIf you\\'re unsure about wether you should get it or not, do it. You won\\'t regret it, unless you\\'re a miserable muggle.I like casting revelio, good timesVery good game been playing it since its release had a great beginning but since the updates having problems  with the graphics for the game with the NPC and my player faces and stuffAmazing game.Very interestingWorld is gorgeous, spells have so far been interesting. Not terribly far in yet but there seems to be a good number of enjoyable puzzles to solve. Ravenclaw, Rowan Pheonix Feather Wand, running around known places from the universe. It\\'s a dream come true.while still a bit glitchy this is a well put together game that is truly open world. You can go anywhere you want to you just might not survive the encounters.hary potrur a Rizzard HARRYBest RPG since Witcher 3 buy it combat is great open world is compact not like an Ubisoft game. PS i don\\'t even like the harry potter movies !really huge upgrade from the previous game enjoying it alotthe best game ever for a potter fan!Amazing game. It’s been a very long time since a game had left me not wanted to go to work or sleep.Pretty solid game, even with all the the hate it has gotten. Most stable launch I have seen in a long time.very nicealways got my 14 inch wand in my handBrought back old memoriesTIS GOODcool ass game, perfect for harry potter fans or somethingFantastic game!!I love this game. Graphic\\'s are great, the story is wonderful and all the details are very charming.I\\'m hoping for some DLC\\'s!Well put together universe. Good story, great attention to detail, lots to do...Very enjoyable.Really good gameIts a good game that unfortunately is relying too much on \"we member\" if you know what i mean.needs more side quests and npc interactions plus the main character needs to shut the f up with his repetitive comments, then it would probably be a great gameDo NOT buy unless you at least meet the RECOMMENDED requirements! Unfortunately the specs given for this game are pretty misleading. I have a GTX 1050 ti, and I meet all the other requirements for the game. This meets the minimum requirements but not the recommended. I have had nothing but trouble getting this game to work. I have read that other people who have much better hardware than me also have this problem so I\\'m not sure if it\\'s the game or my hardware. I can run the game on low, but even then there are fps stutters and texture popping. I was content to play like this until this morning, I booted up the game and now it\\'s unplayable with major graphics issues, and audio stutter. At this point I have spent so much time getting this game to work, I\\'m ready to give up. Maybe I\\'ll try again after some patches come out and my patience for the whole thing has reset.Amazing all roundThis game is amazing! the visuals, story line, the MAGIC! JKR is my favorite person in the world for creating such an amazing world. I will support anything she stands for and I will support anything she comes out with next. The JKR haters are missing out :)It\\'s a damn good thing Elden Ring didn\\'t release the same year as this game.This game is Game of The year, in whatever year it\\'s released. Jfc. K that\\'s all I have time to write, back to it.The game Potterheads have been waiting for for nearly 20 years.Best open world game I have play in a while, completely addictedwand go boom boom and bad guy die avardakadbra motherfuckerGame is a top notch RPG set in the Harry Potter universe. Do not let any of the reviews about JK rowland detour you.

I never was a fan of the Harry Potter franchise but this is just a good gameYes but not optimized very well (in terms of memory and lag) great gameplay thoCan\\'t even start this POS. Constant crashes...This may be the next skyrim-tier open world. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this game was far better than any notions or nay-saying done before the release. One of my favorite games since Elden Ring. 10/10 very good outside of the token trans npc.Is fun and has a Victorian vibe to it. my wife loves harry potter books and stuffGame good but needs some performance optimizations.i couldnt be happier. i really recommended to any harry potter fan and who ever dream to be wizard, come and get lost in this wonderland.amaze balls.Chi lascia negative ha problemi 😢Bhama lama ding dong aWaDa kEdAWrAseriously amazing game, if it takes awhile to download thats normal!! my computer isnt the greatest but im able to play on medium setting with little to no problems, im too scared to try it on highAbsolutely incredible level of detail and effects, to the point that the entire experience is just surreal.

[/b]I definitely love this game but I find that sometimes it crashes when I\\'m trying to run it. Still would recommend it to my friends!Oh my god this game is probably the greatest piece of Harry Potter media ever created.I am officially transphobic nowgood gameHogwarts Forever !Very good gameIF this game were a drug, it would be heroine.Fantastic game!  Great voice acting! I want more please.  Great Story line, Music, Graphics, Play-ability, and Fun.  Hooked from the intro cut scene.

Wish it had Quidditch.It\\'s like Skyrim but you actually commit to being a Mage rather than giving up and becoming an archer for the 43rd time.im a big harry potter fan myself and this brings all the good memories backGet it youll love it!this game is really good ive only played for 8 hours and its greatGOAT OF A GAME the pc performance is pretty horrible, even with rtx 3080ti, running the global graphical setting at \"High\" the framerate will drop to 30 to 40 fps here and there most of the time. it feels like a good game within my limited 3 hrs of gameplay, but it\\'s impossible to overlook the extremely poor pc performance.best game of 2023This game has got me as excited as when witcher 3 came out. I am only 4 hours deep but felt like 40 min. Highly recommend playing this one.This game is so fantastic!good gameIt\\'s great.best gameMost unrealistic part is that Ravenclaw won the house cup in my play through.  8/10 otherwiseEntertaining adventuregood game. Be better if steam didn\\'t force us to put a comment.Got an access to upgrades on lvl 18 (the quest is for lvl 4), instantly had 14 new perks10/10 hogwarts experienceit\\'s one of the best games i\\'ve ever played!In my opinion, this just doesn\\'t share the same magic as the books or the movies, and it falls flat in comparison to other open-world RPG adventures I have enjoyed. I think the core issue is that the player protagonist doesn\\'t have much personality, and that limited what they could do with the storytelling and immersion. This game was safely designed and well marketed, but has since fallen off the radar in a market well supplied with punchy and innovative offerings launching every week.Absolutely best game out their right now would highly recommend getting the game without a question. Everything about this game has been done really well for example the main story plot, side quests, characters and the game mechanics worth every penny 👍It\\'s every Harry Potter\\'s fan dream come trueMy saves were deleted after like 20 hours. Then I fixed it. It is a really good game but the stuttering is out of this world, with no patch in sight. A patch to fix the stuttering would be most appreciated.BIS, let\\'s goEverything I ever wanted in a Harry Potter game.good gameWhen it\\'s working properly this game looks amazing however I have been plagued with issues which has stopped me playing until they\\'re fixed!

Que jogo... recomendo absurdos.[b][i]YOU CAN\\'T IMAGINE HOW INCONVENIENT TRAVEL WAS BEFORE I INVENTED FLUU POWDER[/i][/b]game goodThe Harry Potter game I\\'ve always wanted.Best game I\\'ve played in 2 to 3 years.I just got 20 years youngerThis game is really addictive.Game is allot of fun, the talents and how you use them change each play through.Kind of boringVery cozy gamei have played the game for 9 hours straight if its the game or my wife obviously im picking the game its so addictivethis game has everything a harry potter fan would mostly want. it is full of magic,story lines,combat and you get so immersed into the game. that you just keep on playing. it has been a long time for me sinds i found a game\\'s story so good i loved it.Need more beast, hope that they will add dlc for the new beastThe game is beautiful. Quests are well thought and very entertaining. Puzzles and secrets everywhere. Highly recommend it, specially for harry potter fans. Combat is fluid and dynamic.GAME IS GAMEbastard ominisThis game has so much to do and has gorgeous graphics 10/10 recommend playing it for all HP lovers!given the high expectations before the game is released, the game is not too bad!I would relate my experience with this game with a constant, never-ending orgasm, Even after taking my time and 100%\\'ing the game, I somehow just end up back in there ready to do it again!levio~SAAAAAHWorth it just to walk around the castle. Every thing is animated.Actually fun and entertaining!It makes you feel like spidermanvery good very nice*REVELIO*Revelio!A good AAA single player game with no micro-transactions? In 2023? well I\\'m impressed at the bare minimum we have come to expect from games these days...this game is super fungreat game if you love exploring and love fanistyIt was hyped up a lot and actually feel like it was pretty accurate.Very fun game, open world, can play as a dark wizard or a nice one.A bit of glitches but it\\'s recently released so there will be patches.Worth every single dollar.I couldn\\'t even judge the game itself. For those that can play it, it probably is good. But for us that crash like harrys broom into the whoomping willow... wellStrong 7 /10This game is basically my childhood dream come true. I never got my letter at 11, but now, as I am 22 it finally happened <3Love it! its so versatile!RAWENCLAW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Game good.Overall It\\'s an alright game.It\\'s objectively not a great RPG tho.I\\'d recommend it for harry potter fans but if you expect a fully fledged RPG, try something else.This will be a no recommendation until they fix the performance issues tho.extremely satisfying to play and view. I7 12700 rtx 3060. no stuttering. laptop gets HOT 85-90 degrees on cpu, high 80\\'s gpu. Nice to play a game you don\\'t have to play for weeks to advance 5 minutes in the story line.good game, good story, fun, Sebastian is the bestAfter 30 hours of play time, I feel ready for this review. At first, this game is amazing. The world Avalanche built is incredible, Hogwarts is just perfect. As a Harry Potter fan, I read all the books when I was a kid and being able to explore Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest and everything else is awesome. That said... Let\\'s talk about real gameplay.This game does not trully rewards exploration. AT ALL. Let\\'s be honest... going through dungeons or puzzles to get to the end and be like \"oh cool, my scarf now can be blue.\" or \"ANOTHER DAMN UGLY GLASSES THAT I WON\\'T USE. THANKS\" is frustrating. So after a while I just gave up on exploring because it feel like wasted time.Do you really expect me to go all the trouble of that many collectibles to get a robe color? Or a broom appearance? Nope.The AI is DUMB. Despite the combat looking much better than I expected, after a few hours it feels a LOT repetitive. It is not really challengin: just find a combo you like, keep pressing R2 and looking at your char to know when to press dodge or block. I mean... every fight feels exactly the same. It is boring. There are no different strategies that really matter.Honestly... at this point, I\\'m just going to burn through the story and hope to see the end of this.10/10, my PC was ready for takeoff every time I played this game, but it was well worth it.Avoid, still plenty of bugs and now my game is stuck on loading screen...game is dopeHaven\\'t even explored half of this game and it\\'s so fun. The things you can do are insane! So much exploration, fun side quests, and so far a really good story! 10/10!one of the better games i have seen in a wile for sure;]]]]]]]]ZULULULLLLNot a huge harry potter fan, but the game and world building is great. Highly recommend for anyone that enjoys single player open world RPGs with a good story.Fun combat and pretty good story seriously marred by tons of Ubisoft formula tedium. They should\\'ve just filled up the world with more proper content instead of tens of Merlin chores and invisibile collectables. 82/100.You can pet the catsAmazingly FUN.This is the Harry Potter game I\\'ve been waiting for!I enjoy it very well would recommendAmazing game play, graphics, immersion, so many collectibles and side quests and spells to choose from. This game truly is addicting and worth the price for the amount of hours you\\'ll get out of it! This is the Hogwarts game I\\'ve always wanted.Endless enjoymentStory line is really good. Lots of side quests to do to keep you busy.super funListen... Ravenclaw is not THAT bad...incredibleIncendio 🔥🔥I love this game. I played Elder Scrolls for almost 20 y staring with Oblivion. I can see this game with the same potential. I hope they keep making more Hogwarts. Pleas, Pleas.Wonder full graphics! Great world map! and also the first piece of Harry Potter media to include a trans character!I haven\\'t enjoyed a game this much in a long time and this one is that good, it has the potential to be game of the year.Love the game, and it works on my potato computer which is a plus.All I\\'m going to say is this game is VALID, PERIOD..shit game waste of money:) good gameGreat game so far.EVERYTHINGgood gameFantastic game for Harry Potter fans.Avada Kedavra!i really do like this game the game is goodGreat gamefuck jk rowlinggood game though\"You\\'re a wizard Harry\"Love it! Of course it\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s pretty damn close.Absolutely top tierAwesomely fun game.Performance is decent and game play is amazing. They made the combat system feel smooth and strategic.Amazingly detailed and magical, JKR can eat a mound of dirt and catch some avada kedavra.Definitely worth the buyI really like Harry Potter. Most fun I\\'ve had with a game in awhile.Ancient magic of EVADE ROLL and \\'PRESS x TO KILL\\'Immersive experience of SOCIETY WE LIVE IN TODAY (twitter edition)Cutting edge technology of MEDIUM-LOW AND SLOW on 3060Ti (artifacts included)Revealing history of Hogwarts THAT DOES NOT MATCH ITS PRESENTGroundbreaking gameplay of SPINNING WORLD GLOBES, PETTING THE CATS and PILFERING PRIVATE PROPERTY in plain sightIngenious wand combat system right from PIANO CLASSES, and WOW COOLDOWN MANAGEMENTA single player experience WITH \\'A MOUNT AND A HAT\\' DLC FOR 20 EUROS ON TOPI could go on like this for a long time... But I actually do not see any reason to spend that much time. My review is one  in tens of thousands, no one will evem ever read this.I could say that most of the the game is well made. But the fact is that the most of the actual GAME game is NOT well made. What\\'s really well made, is 3D decorations of Hogwarts itsef, surrounding areas and other visual stuff. But the most of the actual game mechanics feel clunky and look like a list of missed oportunities, and NOT immersive at all. And still, I see a lot of \\'Positive\\' reviews that only run through the things they \\'don\\'t like\\' and still say \\'yes I recommend\\'. Like, people. Come on. Be honest!And the most important lesson here would be: Harry Potter and Dark Souls just do not mix well.great game any potter head would loveGreat games full of magic and nostalgia. Hours and hours of exciting game play and adventure. Exactly what was needed!Merlin’s beard, Potter!Amazing Game! Definitely worth all the hype!Great combat mechanics and super fun. Side quests are not tedious and often give players experience and awards them with items useful to improve character abilities.Had high expectations for this game and it has met all of them and more. Wonderful atmosphere, combat, story, and characters. If you\\'re a fan of the HP universe and RPGs, this game is for you! Can pet cats / 10wasdfadfWhat the hell you did to that game?First few days very nice graphics, smooth running, revelio here revelio there....And then after some update everything looks like when you wake up after 5 days weekend in different city still on drugs.Polishing details are missing, textures are fked up, everything looks like the graphics did not render completely.Utter rubbish.And it was working very good before.What have you done...great combat, good skill upgrades although no skillpoint refunds. Lots of lore but interesting even to a non-fanYou\\'re a Wizard HarryToo many tech issues.  Save your money until the game has been finished.You get to be a wizard AND piss off the blue hairsJust so slow and boring. Hardest difficulty doesn\\'t pose a challenge. I force myself to play it in hopes of SOMETHING to get me happy about it.Oh yeah don\\'t forget the fucking platforms, shit repetetive level design. And when the combat is actually satisfying, give a total of 10 minutes of it. Useless boring game that looks good.Fun to playthis is act of love from meEngaging story and the fighting mechanics are a lot more fun than I would have expectedPretty ok game.  One of the issues at this point is that it needs a lot of optimizing.  I run a beefy machine and still have a latency and frame issue.Great game but it keeps crashing.I\\'ve tried to grin and bear it but with my drivers updated and hardware that\\'s definitely up to the task...it\\'s not good enough when i\\'ve paid almost sixty quid on a gameLess Game play , more Of cutsense, maybe rather than making a game, you guys should have made a netflix series.Very funUnfortunately, it can\\'t be played in Multiplayer and doesn\\'t have the Re-Talent skill system.... if the makers can. ....This game has a chance to win this year\\'s Game of the Year award.fun to play, though some bugs and overtime if youre good at combo and dodging potions does seems to matter but its good thoughThis is basically what every kid dreamed they could do in HogwartsGreat gameBrilliant.Game was Absolutely amazing... until it deleted my saveit\\'s coolCast the [i]Revelio Charm[/i] in order to see this review. No idea how 30hs passed in this game. And after all this time, is till unlocking new features, spells and story to me. Is incredible, one of the best games out there, ever. I am looking forward to fully explore it, is alot of fun.Combat is a lot of fun, love the flying, and Hogwarts looks outstanding( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)AAA animal crossing 10/10A lot of effort went into making this game look great but not much went into the actual gameplay itself.  I was hooked for the first 10 hours or so and then it became a shallow slog.  This is not a bad game just disappointing and mediocre.  For generic combat/looting/idle mechanics with a Hogwarts skin look no further.  If you want to actually roleplay a hogwarts student rather being forced into the role of a psychopathic murderous spell caster then this is not the game.I wish Steam allowed partial refunds for pricey games like this that put in just enough effort to get you well past the 2 hour window before revealing their shallowness.As someone who enjoys the Harry Potter movies but isn\\'t necessarily a die-hard fan, I was excited to try out \"Hogwarts Legacy\" after hearing rave reviews from my friend who is a Potterhead. I went all-in and purchased the deluxe edition, eager to explore the stunning and immersive world that awaited me.And I wasn\\'t disappointed - the game truly is a visual marvel, with so much to discover and do. Whether you enjoy puzzles, collecting fantastic beasts (which are essentially the game\\'s version of Pokémon), or unraveling mysteries, there\\'s always something new to keep you engaged.After completing the main mission, though, I found myself feeling somewhat unsatisfied. The characters\\' side stories felt confusing, and I\\'m not sure whether it was because of the choices I made or something else, but the outcome didn\\'t seem to make sense within the larger narrative. It was as if the game had already predetermined an ending that didn\\'t quite fit.In addition, there were some performance issues with raytracing, even though I have an RTX 3080 that should be able to handle any raytracing game with ease at 1440p. I was able to find mods that helped to alleviate this problem, but it was still disappointing to encounter these issues in the first place.As such, while \"Hogwarts Legacy\" certainly has its moments, I don\\'t feel comfortable recommending it at this time. And especially considering the standard edition\\'s hefty price tag of €60, it\\'s hard to justify spending that much money on a game that comes with performance issues that players may need to fix on their own.I really wanted to love this game, and it\\'s not bad at all, but there is too much bad gamedesign to make it a great game. If you want an atmospheric game its a 10/10 (if you somehow manage to run it at max settings) Its the gameplay where it falls short! Tedious grinding in a singleplayer game, to enable you to to more tedious and boring gameplay, is just bad gamedesign! The game seems littered with content, but once you scratch the surfuce you will find out just how much of the same bs is duplicated and thrown out all over the place..Ex. trials of merlin could have been a more fleshed out side-quest with 5-10 interesting puzzles in series, and would unlock some appearances or something in the line of that. instead you have to do boring grinding, just to not be pestered with a full inventory of gear every 5 min, its just bad gamedesign! !spoiler! And if that isnt enough, the game wont let you finish the game without you giving in to all the grind! V E R Y bad gamedesign! The bad game design makes the game land on a overall (4/10) score, its that bad gamedesign! very sad!nice game!!!!!really recommend this game to all the potter\\' fans!!!!!for those who are not there fans, try it! and you will fall in love with harry potter! Nice story!!!!Nice Game!!!!Gets interesting everydayExceeded my expectations by a mile, flying and combat is very satisfying and fun :)) +we can use unforgivable curses, so that makes it ten times funner in my bookvery good gameGood shit. Dumstrang next, pleaseMuch Swish, such flick, very leviosaExcellent game, a bit of performance issue but that\\'s understandable on early access.worth every cent.So I\\'ve been on the fence with this game since release. I have played a fair amount, but at the moment this seems to be driven almost by compulsion than enjoyment. The world is beautiful, yet there isn\\'t a lot in it. The phrase \\'wide as an ocean, shallow as puddle\\' applies perfectly here which shows what a trap an open world can be for a video game. What there is to do in the world consists mostly of go to a location marked on the map, go down a short corridor or tunnel, find a chest, and you\\'re done. Sometimes there\\'s a very simple puzzle before the chest can be reached or perhaps instead of a chest it is some other macguffin. More infuriating is the rewards from these chests are either tiny amounts of currency or randomised gear which quickly becomes useless except to sell for small amounts of currency you don\\'t need because everything was purchased long ago.The story itself is confused and nonsensical. Who is our character? Why did they start late? Do they have family? No idea! Could be an orphan or a particularly angsty teenager. Maybe they\\'re muggleborn. For such a seemingly important person who even the Ministry has taken an interest in, no one seems to care where you came from. So much just happens in this story for no reason, and even the characters sometimes take a double-take. At one point your character even says \\'At this point, I\\'ve just learned to go along with it.\\' when explaining the story thus far to another character. Writers: if you feel your character in universe would say this, your writing is bad. I haven\\'t completed the game and am uncertain if I will, but I doubt some sudden revelation will fix the story.This also isn\\'t a game about being a Hogwarts student. If anything, the game is embarrassed that it is set in a school in the first place. You participate in 3.5 classes, though these consist of doing one activity and then a cutscene. After that, every other class is simply a cutscene. Instead you\\'ll do assignments which often don\\'t have anything to do with the spell you\\'ll learn, and then your Divination teacher will teach you a defensive spell for some reason. Hilariously, the best integration of assignments with spell learning is when the Hogwarts caretaker who is supposed to be in charge of student discipline teaches you how to break and enter and then proceeds to tell you to do it all over the game world. The game actively encourages criminality as well since finding items for your little hub are usually hidden in other people\\'s homes behind locks. You\\'ll spend far more time in Argyllshire looting said homes than you will in school, though evidently the classes are taking place off screen since teachers will endlessly comment on how well you are doing. Am I doing well? Weird, I haven\\'t been inside these walls since September, but look at these fancy, contemporary clothes I just dug out of a 500-year-old-tomb. Was super easy as the door was open, and all I had to do was walk down a corridor, take a left, and there was the chest. Fashion sure hasn\\'t changed much in 500 years, eh?As I said, it is a beautiful world, and Hogwarts is realised in painstaking detail. It\\'s just a shame that optimisation seems to have been ignored. Even on a fairly beefy rig, the framerate can suddenly crawl. This is annoying normally, but in fights it becomes infuriating as your inputs won\\'t be recognised in time to block or dodge attacks. Some enemies cause this all the time such as trolls. It\\'s also a frequent occurrence to simply fall through the game map, but thankfully you can hop on your broom and fly back up through the ground.I\\'d say in short this game needed months back in oven, and I really wish they had actually tried to capture the setting of the books, that is: a student going to a magical school. Even a curfew could have been fun done well, and why were house points taken away? It\\'s not bad as a scenic journey through the countryside, a walking tour of Hogwarts, or possibly if you are itching to murder many hundreds of faceless witches and wizards as a 15-year-old. As an RPG though it fails pretty miserably and plays a lot like an MMO, just in single player.its alrightMust-have if you\\'re a Potterheadnice gameLove the game, amazing open world to explore for harry potter fans, story is a little lacking but still very enjoyable with tons to do.too goodI have been transported to the wizarding world that I forgot that I have a job.fun game!It\\'s a very fun free roam game, full of magic, great stories and secrets. If you\\'re a fan of the books/films or not, this game is suited for everyone who likes a good adventure.i just played it for a few hours and im still at the beginning but its already safe to say that this game worth every penny i spentIt is a good game but it was quite hard for me to understand how to play against hard bossespet the cat! wowSuper fun and immersive.  I\\'m greatly enjoying this!This game has re-ignited my passion for single-player adventure games.Just One Reason: The magic fighting is very entertaining!It\\'s marketed as an open-world RPG but it\\'s really not. Exploration is highly repetitive and the combat/gear/progression systems are not well-designed. There\\'s also not much room for personalisation, no morality system and none of the dialogue choices actually matter, so as a result you can\\'t really relate much with the main character throughout. In a nutshell, it delivers the basics of what is expected of a game set in the HP universe, but there\\'s a lot of wasted potential as an open world RPG. If there\\'s going to be a sequel to this, I hope it can be developed by a studio who\\'s more experienced in designing RPGs.Apart from the caracter gets a robotic voice if you lower or higher the voice pitch, the game is greatПутешествие в детство. Огромная благодарность художникам, дизайнерам и композитору игры за окружение. Моё почтение, всё на высшем уровне.liked everything, disliked nothing.  (hope that helps)Really good if you can run it smoothly..Its the harry potter game that if waited all my lifeSo far very fun and you can easily play for hours.Felix Felicis ? PS5 extra-quest ? DLC where ?Story is quite engaging and the combat is pretty fun. Wish there was more options of spells though.It\\'s a really good game, the combat is fun, story is entretaining and the open world feels like it\\'s alive. 100% worth it.GOOD BUT PLS PERFORMANCE FIXESLinear and not really replayable, a bit clumsy controls, but you can get used to. No choices, you will be forced to act as scripted.Still beatiful, fun and moreover - filled with references, humor and easter eggs. Definitely worth it\\'s price.top notch game, nice graphics, plenty of things to do and explore. High attention to detail. Such a great game highly recommend itIt\\'s not a bug; it\\'s called magic.It would be nice to have a PVP0/10I spent 6 hours troubleshooting this game and I\\'ve not once been able to play it despite my \"32 minutes of Playtime\". I\\'ve tried every work around and I can\\'t even play. I\\'ve played free games that had less issues, Star Citizen and Cyberpunk 2077 ran 100x better and I could actually play. Warner Bros. should pay people to play because this was not worth the $60 spent on this. What a waste of time.best game of 2023 for me so far.avada kadavraInsanely good.Absolutely marvellous game. What a nostalgic return to Hogwarts this was...G.O.T.Y.a Harry Potter fan dreams come true. Flawless gameEven if you dont like harry potter this game is goodi can finally be a wizzy from midevil timesGot the early access and the game just wont run. Absolutely mintSir- ona :DEasy 10/10 game. its hogwarts what more do you want. pc issue aside it plays amazing. it looks like all roads point to hogsmeade.Give us multiplayerI like garlicThe game is fun Had a few graphical bugs but nothing that didn\\'t get fixed by reloading the game It needs more enemies and bosseshuggkjlhiukjjuhojklhiperfect.expecto patronammmmmmmmmmBest Wizarding World game to date!very funsuch a fun \"magical\" experienceIt isn\\'t a perfect game.  But it\\'s still really fun and better than I thought it was going to be.  Can\\'t wait for more content.Apart from the fact the game won\\'t work well unless you have the yet to release 50 series GPUs, and the voice actors came from Fiverr. It\\'s a brilliant game!This game is very good. Highly recommend itbeautiful game, very satisfying fightingWell done and plays greatGreat Story fun gamplayI\\'m a HufflepuffAnything from the trolley?as someone who has never watched the harry potter films read the books or played the previous games... so far ive really enjoyed it tbh.Probably one of the best games I have ever played.Outdated graphics but fun gameplay.Repetitive quests but fun combat.Confusing controls but satisfying outcomes.8/10. Considering the lack of good game releases recently, this is a godsend.The game is beautiful, and it is the game of the year for 2023. Also, the game is distinguished by the simple open world, and also the player’s movements are very wonderfulI do not recommend this game , after playing 20 hours i started speaking to snakesgod I love Forspoken its a great ga... wait a secondthe gameAmazing game! I typically don\\'t get into games like this, but this one has captivated me. So well done!I like to cast spells and pretend that I am a wizard and do cool magic wizard flipsI thought that there would be something like Bulli, in the end it turned out something sickly sweet and toothless, with unrealistically ideal characters...+Great graphics+ Magical atmosphere in the game world...+fluffy, cats and other furry animalsAnd that\\'s where all the positives of the game ended =(-Poor editor when creating a character-badly written characters-poorly written main character-Short and sometimes boring story quest-lack of romanceДумала, что будет что то вроде Bulli, в итоге получилось что то нечто приторно сладкое и пушистое...There are no consAs a Flipendo user, I agree with the game8/10 overallwould buy it againIts alittle buggy, would appreciate it if the developers fix that.I can\\'t believe they made you play as a Br*tish person, absolutely disgusting.I feel sad that the game is over but happy at the same time that it exists 100/100A game of missed opportunities. Aside that it runs poorly, there are some REALLY disappointing game mechanics:1. There is nothing to do in Hogwarts and the game constantly gives you quests to go explore the outside world.2. The room of requirement: I would gladly go to the potion classroom and the greenhouse to brew potions and plant plants. Same goes for the pets. Room of Requirement should have been a place to practice your spells or just a room that you can decorate/upgrade your equipment/etc.3. You can\\'t sell potions or plants. Why is finding ugly equipment the only way of making gold in game?4. Most common thing you get as a reward is (mostly) ugly looking piece of equipment to no end.5. You buy ALL potions recipes from Hogsmeade. What is potion professor for? - to teach you spells LOL6. Why can\\'t I buy things at Zonko\\'s AND USE THEM IN COMBAT or to troll my classmates/professors? 7. Why can\\'t I buy things at Honeydukes and use them to replenish my HP? Or even gift them as presents to to other ppl or just buy them to waste my gold.8. Really? No Quidditch and it is because the headmaster sucks? Really?9. Enemies: Humans, trolls, spiders and inferi. Good job.10. What is the point of locked doors if there are 10 more locked doors after it. SO ANNOYING. Can you please make the Alohomora 3 an instant unlock?11. I think I could have designed better staircase. 12. Ghosts and portraits are almost non interactable with.13. There is no points collection rewards. I think it would be fun if instead of having a non meaningful scene of you attending the class, YOU actually attending the class, prof asking questions and if you answer them correctly, you get points. This knowledge could be obtained from chests, ghosts and other things for example instead of just rewarding ugly meaningless equipment.14. I wish I could have an ACTUAL relationship meters where I can do quests for professors, different houses and local folk. Would be amazing if as I advance the relationships I get lore, I am able to visit other house rooms and get different quests if I decide to advance them (instead of everything being offered).15. HUD sucks. I don\\'t need a million markers on my map nor (ugly yellow pixelated) quest indicators. I JUST NEED A COMPASS. Maybe instead of marking everything on the map, after advancing a certain quest, through conversation with NPC you would get locations of near places of interest. I am sure that there will be more disappointing things as I advance in the game, but so far I am finding more things that I am disappointed about than amazed with.Hogwarts is beautifully designed and there are some really neat easter eggs and somewhat challenging puzzles that aren\\'t obvious and need a min or two to think about. But the rest is just repetitive and not challenging at all. I see no reason why they would waste time on making a large map with random villages instead of making Hogwarts a main place of exploration.This game is awsome! coop or mp asap =)So much fun. Reminds me of Fable in a way but Harry Potter which is my ultimate dream game! Super excited to keep playingGame doesnt even load past shaders gets stuck my total trime played has been spent on a screen warning me of seizures or trying to load shaders on a bar that doesnt moveThis game has amazing visuals and the combat system is pretty good too. But this game is sold as a RPG and it has no RPG elements. You don\\'t have choices in this game and you can\\'t be a particular wizard either. Instead you\\'re a wonderboy perfect, can do everything wizard that is always cheery and respectful.Oh, and how did they make learning new spells fun? Every time you\\'re ready to learn a new spell you have to complete the most boring assignments to learn it. Either it is doing some combat feats or drinking multiple potions at the same time, throwing out some plants at the same time. It\\'s so freaking tedious!And also what\\'s up with the menu design? Navigate with a freaking pointer while its much faster to just press up or down. No sell all button while you have sell a LOT of gear.Yeah, they shower you with meaningless gear in this game, probably 99% of my play time was spent just changing gear for a green that is better then a legendary 4 drops later.There\\'s more but fuck listing everything. Also to be fair, good music and voice acting, although the voice acting doesn\\'t really have to push itself when it comes to emotion.From 120 fps to 10-20? Ok, npI have to say I am very happy with the game, I love the diversity and the amazing graphics. I am a huge fan. This is a wonderful game. I love it.Best game ever. I have been enjoying it. Hogwarts Legacy is everything I have wanted. Thank you the best game.best gameGood gamegoooooooodHogwarts. RPG. Amazing.please add multiplayer and quidditch.too many nerd up in here. give me more draco malfoyamazing game with good storyAvada Kadabra!You can pet cats. 10/10Wonderfully fun.A little boring...in battle.they need to fix the lagg.I chrck every settings in the game still.have it.Using helios 500 nvidia 1070 8gb,32 Gb Ram  and +2Tb ssd 970 evo plus. If you can help me i can play  the game joy.Excellent gameplay, wonderful and immersive world of wizarding. What else do you need?6 hours in and i haven\\'t even done my first story quest yet. good stuff.Glorified Ubisoft game with harry potter reskin. Doesn\\'t help that the game has been trying to go politically correct that totally breaks immersion. Your character is basically a \"Yes sir\" or a \"Slightly moody teenager.\" Economy seems totally busted, with at it\\'s core either a \"poacher sim\" or a \"sell my 1000th useless loot.\" RPG elements in the game don\\'t really go far, with using \"unforgivable curses\" having NO repercussions whatsoever to your character in game story wise. Suffers alot from Cyberpunk 2077\\'s \"beautiful set piece but a boring game.\" The stuttering and frame drops also definitely DO NOT help this game at all (for reference im playing with a 3070 and still getting huge stuttering in 1080p or 1440p)...Main story introduces you to an antagonist, that seems \"strong\" and is trying to get to a power that the player is also trying to reach. But it doesn\\'t really explain the stakes at hand at all? Vague asf and ultimately not that interesting. Can\\'t believe i stopped playing elden ring for this.I don\\'t have any words to describe this game. 10/10The devs didn\\'t give me enough time to upgrade my PCAlot of small bugs, but it doesnt ruin the game.This is the shittiest PC port I have ever played. The stuttering I experience even after the patch renders the game completely unplayable. Character faces and expressions are lifeless, and the whole world is soulless. The attempt at making an inclusive character creator is lackluster at best, and insulting at worst. There are still clearly two stereotypical gender expressions. Sure you can mix and match feminine/masculine voices with a masculine/feminine body and title (witch/wizard), but there are still only two of each, clearly meant to correspond with the cis normative gender dichotomy. The token trans character is a joke, and feels like a derogatory pity party. Seriously, don\\'t buy this game, it\\'s unplayable and clearly not ready for release. I would have gotten a refund, but I spent over two hours trying to fix this pile of human waste, so I might finish the game if it gets fixed. Still not worth buying this lifeless mess. If you want to buy this game regardless of your money going to the genocide of trans people, get some help.Worth every cent. So much nostalgia. Love itCool game I must say, not a big fan of harry potter thing, but its fun. Huge world, nice quests, good story, combat 8/10. I recommend it, but wait for -20% offer.Now that it\\'s finally working for me after the last update, I\\'m having the time of my life just magic-ing about Hogwarts!its honestly one of my favorite games nowVery fun game, a bit glitchy and laggy rn but still enjoyable9/10I\\'m really, really enjoying this game! I don\\'t care for all the background controversy. Just enjoy life for what it is, and enjoy this game :Dнеоптимизированное говнищеAs long as there is DENUVO my review will be NEGATIVE.***Enquanto houver DENUVO meu review vai ser NEGATIVO.Me and My PC are sweaty.YOU WILL STINK LIKE POTTER IF YOU DON\\'T PLAY THIS GAME!very goodIf you love Harry Potter, you will love this game. Simple as.good gamegoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopretty decent game tbhYou\\'re a wizard, Harry.Amazing game, easily 9/10. Ravenclaw!Game is god damn amazing! Everything about it is amazing! 10/10Game of the Year material - definitely the best game ever created from the Wizarding World universe.And even if you don\\'t like Harry Potter at all, you will still receive an amazing fantasy RPG experience.10/10they make you play as a british person (also this game crashes alot)One of the most better story adventure games I played lately, slightly reminds of bully as a school vibeshadow wizard money gang. WE LOVE CASTING SPELLZ!Open world is REAL the battle system is intricate enough to have souls like components (which game doesn\\'t huh?) but to stay unique as well.amazing, better than i expectedGame is so good, everyone should play itnudy w chuj xdGOOD GAMEGTA X Bully X Harry PotterThis game returned me my childhood memories and made a new even better memories. Best game everHands down game of the yearOmg so much fun! and im not really that into the harry potter stuff but this game is great!guess I\\'m transphobia now sorry everyone.My recommendation: Just watch a \\'\\'Hogwarts Legacy All Cutscenes/Full Movie\\' video. Not worth playing.Quite a forgettable experience.Bought it on the HP hype, should have watched a few hours of a let\\'s play video, to realize this just isn\\'t a 2023 RPG.AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i love itlost all game progression after 39 hoursExcellent game for the Harry Potter franchise. Definitely recommend.it is a good game great storyline beautiful graphics but please fix stuttering and FPS dropLove Everything about this game and little to no bugs on release!A lot of fun to be had here, But the combat is very easy even on hard mode but just being in the Harry Potter world is enough if you are really into the Wizard world this is a dream for you. I give it 7/10 its not the best game ever made but it is up there.A really good game. I like it.  It has all - the story, the action and more.Great game! Feel right at home eat Hogwartsgame mechanicsThis game breaks immersion everytime I get immersed into it, the game runs like shit the characters are unlikable and I blieve that this game is overhyped.The boi who lived come to die........AVADA KEDAVRA!!!!!Kino train, get on boardavada kedavraring bitches is funI have spent 20 hours on this game and it has reset my progress twice im so fucking done. The first time i thought it might\\'ve just been because i forgot to save or smth and i wasnt that far in so i decided to just restart. The second time, i remember saving and when i try to load a game, there\\'s nothing there. I can\\'t even get a refund because ive played 20 hours and now have no motivation to play it all again.Beautiful Game, fun Combat mechanics and a interesting story.Must have for any Harry Potter Fan and a strong recommendation for any Action RPG Fan.Great gameit seems all roads lead to frame dropsIncredible game. One of the best I have ever played. Worth every dollar.Great Game, would recommendHow to play Hogwarts Legacy:1. Stop looking at negative reviews. 2. Completely ignore the pointless agenda-driven controversy from both sides, you are not hurting anyone, you are not endorsing anything.3. Steal 40$ from your mom.4. Purchase and play the game.5. Enjoy.hogsnorts tha 1its a great game greqat flying mechanics fps drops alot tho still fairly new the story has a typical youre the chosen one but half way thru its niceMISS GARLICKFantastic graphics. Fantastic stories. Fantastic gameplay.Fantastic game.And I am NOT a Harry Potter Fan.It\\'s a good game. Unfortunately, that\\'s enough for purchase in 2023. It\\'s not a brilliant one, like the Witcher 3, but you can expect many hours of pure happiness. I would recommend it.we love casting spellsGreat game, combat is great fun and story is very well made!its to goodAmazing Game love it so muchHorrible on AMD Software. constant crashes and no way around it.Im sure its a great game but practically unplayable for the percentage of the population that plays on AMD.My Specs are: AMD Ryzen 3 3100 4 Core Processor 16GB RAM AMD 6600 XT GPUWaste of $70 Thank you AvalancheMurk dem wizardsGreat Game for all Harry Potter Fans!12/10 wakanda foreverone of the best games you\\'ll playhaving a blast becoming THE wizardloved the game play. hate that spiders are a main part of the game. I hate them and have an intense fear of them. should be a way to change the appearance of spiders so they aren\\'t as spidery looking.There are too many game-breaking bugs to recommend buying this game at this time. There are currently a number of bugs which prevent progressing the main quest line.You\\'re a wizard Har.. *insert player name*it is funWhen poachers trap helpless beasts, it\\'s poaching. And that\\'s bad.When you trap helpless beasts, its \"rescuing\". And that\\'s good.10/10 game. ...SHUT UP DEEK!Unforgivable curses are a horrible and terrible thing...that\\'s why you try to use it on the first living thing you see after acquiring them.Best game everVery exciting game! Extra bonus for pissing of extreme leftists!The game constantly crashes my PC, makes the PC restart, this only happens when playing on this game.Have changed dll files for dlss changed resolution, switched off raytracing and configured my 3090 GPU. Updated windows, drivers but still crashy. Other than that pretty fun game, shame it\\'s giving me a bad time.Please use \"Revelio\" to reveal my review.With this kind of optimization, Avalanche should rename the PC Version to:Payable Today, Playable After 6 Months Edition!good gameReally enjoying the vibe.  There has been alot of thought and love put into this game.  Highly recommend.its goodworth the money so thrillingThe game is good fun, but the difficulty is not very high for the puzzles. You might want to turn off some things related to the HUD since all the info is just handed to you.Pretty kewlit has got to be one of the best games i have ever playedSo far this game is awesome, I\\'m lvl 17 and having a blast, thanks.Thumbs Up!!nice game :)Professor Garlick (✿◕‿◕✿)The Harry Potter game we\\'ve all been wanting years for.Stunning visuals, great music and very detailed environment for HP fans. Combat and gameplay is not that bad either. But story, dialogues and writing in general is horrible. Both very short and uninteresting. I don\\'t know who decided that this game is an RPG but this is not RPG.Dont let the Woke agenda make your decisions for you. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter Universe then give this game a shot, it is worth it.A very good game, if a little bugs but you can still play, believes that one or the other update will solve the problemIt was a fun experience. Exploration within the castle was the best part.Enemies: 5/10Exploration: 9/10graphics: 8/10Story: 7/10This is one of the best single-player games I played in a long time. It is worth every penny, and no regrets about buying it. Dynamic combat is a good choice of spells. Unfortunately, no morality system is in place, but other than that, no complaints.Very good game. Beautiful graphics. Overall absolutely amazing.great game im bustingJust not worth the money. If it\\'s half the price, then yeah go ahead and play and enjoy it for what it is. Nothing in this game is done wholeheartedly. Everything from story to beasts to game play to optimization is like 30-50% of what it should be to push it up to next level. Nothing is done to it\\'s full extent. The UI for PC is complete garbage, scrolling through spell sets that can only have 4 spells at a time is so bad for game play. Probably biggest annoyance.I love it. I love Harry Potter Universe. Worth every penny for me.brilliantNice fun game, really takes you into the wizard world.cant fuck house elf5 hours in and I\\'m quite liking the game! I will definitely complete this and update my review laterits impressive game. for HP fans and not. beautiful maps full of energy. the story is something that is not good or bad. but all other things in the game is magnificent!!!Runs like shit, quite dialogue heavy - wait for patches / salenice gameplaygoooooooddddThis game is incredible, the harry potter game ive always wanted! im constantly in awe of the graphics and detail they put into it! they really out did them self making this game! i bet they are proud of the game they have made :) Love this game man - sadly got performance issues on PC but still looks super beautiful even on lower graphics10/10 recommendPS: dont flame the game - flame jkr and her stupid orgs tyi pat all the catsIt was fun and entertaining, a lot you could do in the game while you were free to go almost anywhere on the mapawwoooooovery funIf you liked the Harry potter franchise you\\'ll feel really pleased and immersed with the game. Its beautiful and I hope they add more to the game like more character customization and spells. Otherwise I am really enjoying the story.Don\\'t buy it until Denuvo is removed, I literally can\\'t run it and I should be able to.Seems like all roads lead to Hogsmead!For now amazingfantastic game. Forget whats going on in the media, this is the game you\\'ve been waiting years to play.This game is fantastic.   FPS I am steady above 60 FPS  usually between 73-112 FPS at most points.  It is running on some medium settings and is still beautiful.  RTX 3070, 16gb ram, i7-12700H.  Game is worth it.I LOVE ITAvada Kedavra left and right!If you like Harry Potter, you must get this.

I absolutely love it :)I\\'ll be walking to a main quest and on the way, chase 3 keys, lure two moths, investigate a bathroom and stroke 7 cats.10/10 ability to sidetrackwe love casting spellsSome bugs here and there. Overall enjoyable experience.I\\'m not good at writing reviews so just going to say it\\'s very much worth playing especially if you love Harry Potter. Also it works good on the Steamdeck and the controls are good as well for it :)From what I\\'ve seen the graphics and storyline are great, there are a few bugs that are expected when the game has just been released, other than that I\\'d rate this a 9/10Best GameThe story isnt very long but still good. The side mission are also creative, which makes it fun to search for them and play them. The combat system is also very well done. I can recommend this game to everybody who like a nice but not too long RPG.interesting gameJ.K.BASED + YWNBAW + RATIOHog. warts.Every time I use the Disillusionment charm to unlock one of the eyeball chests, I reveal myself right before their little eyeball closes forever.I want them to see who ended their watch.

There is so much to do in this game it\\'s unreal!I am in love. It is everything we\\'ve always wanted. I can remember imagining this 15 years ago and wishing you could throw spells around. No game has kept me this engaged in a LONG time.pretty goodbest game of 2023 by farBest game of all time. I love it.Great game. Engaging and the exploration is top notch!Barely started the game but already having great fun :)Incredibly fun, feels like the books/movies, engaging story so far, world feels magical. They did a great job and the game is well worth buying.this game is amazing i just cant play because it wont go past the shaders screenFun gameOne of the best games I have played in years.A beautiful looking fully immersive game that will absolutely delight any fans of the series.  I get the feeling though, that even non-fans, or newcomers to the world of Harry Potter will also love the fullness of the story as well as the beautiful graphics.well put together. just make sure you have the right system to run itA fantastic gameTakes a bit to get into the combat but very fun game!kkr goed My 7 year old self, who read Harry Potter for the first time, couldn\\'t be happier.professor garlick a baddie ongfinally a good AAA gameLove the game just wish they had more friendship quests with other characters!We finally got our letter to Hogwarts. Welcome home, everyone. <3I downloaded Hogwarts legacy on valentines eve prepared to spend the night all by my self. But at the first herbology I saw her! Professor Garlic. now I have spent days writing romantic poems and sending them to the greenhouse. Best game ever 10/10Hands down the Greatest Game I\\'ve had the pleasure of playing.  Do yourself a favor and upgrade your computer and get an HDR10 monitor to enjoy it to the fullest.  If you have any stuttering issues most likely you have 16GB RAM and need to upgrade to 32GB+One of the best drops in yearsshe\\'s pretty rightyou\\'re a wizard harryendless update, can\\'t playThe game overall is very beautiful, But between the many problems that exist and can be easily fixed, such as broom camera locking, frantically searching for revelio pages with little success, and the very basic facial details on npc, maybe hold off on buying it until they give it a good polishtis great11/10 Would highly recommend. this is everything your childhood was about and more! It might appear that I\\'ve only played 10 hours, but I\\'ve already finished the game on PS5 :)Beside the FPS issues, this game is a masterpiece Bless J.K. RowlingThis is a good game really brings you into the wizarding world plus flying on a broom is a big plus its a big open world game give it a try you will not regret it.After patch. Take more than a minute to load the map each time you fast travels. Constantly FPS drop makes the game unplayable.great gameThis game is stunning! Patches are quick and successful. Highly recommendThis game truly feels magical. Never liked Harry Potter but this is something so different.More content, details and passion in any AAA game I\\'ve seenGame of the Year.... (so far)Awesome, even more awesome as Harry Potter fanwands are much too long, 5-6 inches are more than enough tbh. other than pretty fyegame is goodbut after patch that came after feb 15th game become unplayablePet cats and kill goblinsVery well made, so far 5 hrs in and its a great well balanced game!Legit way ,more fun then I expected.Great game! Lots to do.You can pet any cat you seeDon\\'t come to potion class tomorrowHogwarts legacy  is a beautiful game . The combat is really good .Best game everDefinitely worth every cent.Game looks absolutely amazing, but it just does not work on pc as of right now, unless youre running a nasa kinda rig. It stutters, drops frames even in cut scenes and crashes the moment you even think of blinking. Its like RD2 but about a thousand times worse. Whoever greenlit this game for release on pc in this condition should be fired. Loving the game but this needs a patch ASAP. Should be illegal to charge money for a game as unstable as this. (R7 3700x, asus tuf rtx 3070 OC, 16gb ram, 1tb nvme storage)Great immersion into a world I grew up with. Well written characters and questlines. The world feels like the hogwarts from the movies. Fun and unique combat that makes you have to react and change tactics on the fly. Having a really good time so far.Avada KedavraProfessor GarlickI CAN FLY!!!!Good game. I am kinda addicted ngl. 10/10 would recommend it ;)IT IS A FUN GAMEI mean it\\'s aight.Jokes aside, my inner child is happy.Avada KedavraIt\\'s pretty good.gooddddddddddd10/10 Game of the Year.AVADA KEDAVRAIf you\\'re a fan of the Harry Potter world (and not so much of JK Rowling) then this game is for you! It is grindy at times but always rewards you with cool aesthetic rewards, spells, spellcrafts, etc. Don\\'t expect to see anyone from the movies though.i have really enjoyed playing i just finally bought the game and had played three hours straight not gonna lie.10/10 if you\\'re a HP fanOne of my all-time favorite games now!I just hope that they make multiple DLC\\'s because I just want to keep playing it, but sadly I\\'ve beaten the game and all of it\\'s content.Me like crucio spell and levioso animalsReally nice Game.not only the best \"harry potter\" game ever, but one of the best games i\\'ve ever played. it helps i\\'m huge into the wizarding world but even if i wasn\\'t - the game is gorgeous, plays very well and haven\\'t run across any bugs. extremely solid all around!Many hours to play, and the game continues to be exciting and engaging. It\\'s every bit i could have hoped for. They definitely delivered!Magical.amazing gameExpelliarmus!!a beautiful feeling creating your own wand, thank you for the nostalgic shivers the whole game has its gameplay flaws but the world is as it should be \"Magic\" Thank you and I recommend itAmazing visual quality and design of the Hogwarts and the world. Quite nice combat. Poor everything else. Repetitive chest grind, mind-numbing boring quests, identical NPCs, no dialogue options, no plot options. Glorified Visual Novel or worse.tbh i dont really like harry potter movies. but this game. its so fun. it gives that good open world feel with like also a sorta skyrim feel with the magic and stuff.Don\\'t listen to Twitter, this is the game of the year.great game enjoying the open world conceptjust a great game that if you really play it completly it has way more hours of fun than most people thinkIm literally a wizard.Very fun game, endless fun.Why the hell isn\\'t Hogwarts divided into cells? We don\\'t all have NASA computers.A lot of fun, I\\'m not even into the movies but I enjoyed it.Very exciting game, expecially if you like the Harry Potter Universe.Herbology teacher = POG open world = so much to do learned how to fly on broom needed to be level 6 did it at level 20I have a 1080Ti and 16 GB RAM. I am very meticulous in keeping my RAM usage low as well. When this game is running, I am using 80% of my RAM on average and it shows. The game does not run well at all. Setting everything to low made it playable, but still jarring with frame drops and assets taking centuries to render already scaled down textures. I have seen other reviews from people similar specs saying they have no issue, so take it as you will. It was fine enough for long enough that I did not request a refund within Steams policy time, so I played it anyways. Do not take my hours played as an endorsement for the game. I would absolutely not buy it right now unless you have considerably higher specs, as players with similar ones to mine are giving mixed reviews. However, if the performance issues are resolved, I highly recommend purchasing it then or purchasing it for console if you must have it right now. It really is a great game and I will change my review to positive if they fix these issues.Genuinely amazing game. Way better combat than I could have expected. Hope they keep making content and dlc for this game long into the future!Would love to get some of those planned but missed features, more areas in the world to explore, etc.Fantastic gameNothing to say! That so great. Oh my dream, my childhood.This is by far the greatest game I have ever played. The story is engaging and the open world is vast and expansive. You can tell the developers truly cared about Harry Potter!wizard go brrrrrrrrrVery smooth and very attention grabbingWhen the game loads it is beautiful and a great experience. But of the 10 times I have tried to load the game I have only gotten past the shader screen once. The game continues to crash while loading the shaders and it is extremely frustrating.The best open-world game!most of the time I am not playing singleplayer games because I want to enjoy a game with friends (co-op or multiplayer games ) but this game has just done it perfectly for me its 10/10yes its pog if you wanna be a wizardPretty Cool that it makes my wand hardNooo, Just HarryYou\\'re a wizard“LISTEN HERE HAGIRD YOU FAT OAF! I’M NOT A FUCKING WIZARD”Having a blast with thisAmazing, perfect!!! i love it!Boring and repetitive. Obviously mainly for kids. But not that exciting. Great story line but I skip all of the cut scenes because they take so long. The map is empty and there really isnt much to do. The game stutters at times but I will say it is beautiful. But I feel like they should have took more time with it...you cant even keep gear because you fill up quick and having a house is pointless because there is nothing special about it - you cant use your bed and there really is nothing special about day/night. Honestly nothing special about the game in general.This game is amazing! It is almost exactly what I dreamed it would be. The flaws are quite minimal, and the scenery alone is 10/10. Absolutely stunning world and gameplay (especially the combat)!Great fun, amazing visuals, great gameplay and features. only problem is performance and the spell casting bar  (how many spells you can equip and cycle through at once); other than it, it\\'s an amazing gameI am wizard.Revealio deezwand does indeed go soooopI am really enjoying this game! I have and would, definitely suggest this game to friends. I love the open world, the puzzles, and the immersive story line. Its fun to explore the wizarding world as me!Incredible.perfect !!!Avada Kedevaracould be a good game, if the thing ever opened, i have a brand new pc with very high specs and the game wont open, will force my pc to crash on the loading screen. absolute trash on the developers end of quality control.It\\'s great.Reignited my love for the Harry Potter stories.THIS GAME IS DOPE AF. YOU CAN FLY ON A BROOM- No Quidditch.- Missing so much QoL features that it feels frustrating.- Whoever designed the flight controls should be banned from going anywhere near a computer for the rest of their lives.- You don\\'t feel like being a student at all. There are some classes but there are just \"there\", but nowhere close to be a main feature of the game. You become way too overpowered way too quickly, I am pretty confident that at the end of the 5th year (which is only year you will be attending) protagonist can take on Voldemort and win without breaking sweat.- Hogwarts \"looks\" immersive but other than looting stuff there is very little do within it. The things you can interact with is criminally low. There are almost no side activities and chances are you will be seeing your dorm like 2-3 times entire game. I almost forgot where it was.- Outside world is large, again looks amazing and immersive, yet there are only around 20-25 outdoor side quests. Most of it feels repetitive and list of things you can do is again a short one.- Combat. It\\'s the saving grace of the game, extremely fun and executing spell combinations feels very rewarding.- Story feels shallow and short, your choices mostly don\\'t matter and most of the times you won\\'t be given any anyways. There\\'s not much of a roleplaying because devs thought it will be better if they decide what your character think and say most of the situations. It\\'s a very linear experience and there\\'s no replay value.Overall, i think it\\'s a fun yet a VERY flawed game.SWISH AND FLICK THE **** OUT OF IT!Jokes aside this game is awesomemagical fucking gameas a HP fanthis game feels like a dreamthank youLOVE this game![b] It\\'s not great. If anything, it\\'s somewhat mediocre. I\\'ll personally give it a 7/10 but only for its beautifully crafted world and nothing more. I absolutely love flying on a bloom and take in the scenery from above the skies. The gameplay and story however are just below average. [/b][b]The Open world[/b]Beautifully crafted. Absolutely uninspiring mobile game tier of contents scattered around the maps though.I like the field guide page mechanics, it adds more lore reading to the Harry Potter universe and adds value to the exploration.Having 60 random chests just laying around all over some random corridors in Hogwarts however is quite immersion breaking. Needlessly to say it feels wrong having to break into every single houses in the world just to collect the collectibles. This is not what I anticipates from a \"Hogwarts wizard RP game\" experience.Hundreds of Merlin trials of the exact same 5 puzzles? Caves that lead to a chest that gives you … 16 gold? Not to mention all the doors and chest gatekeeped by random locks, requiring you to suck it up to Gladwin and hunt down moon statutes for 6 hours just to learn Alohomora. The contents in the open world gets old fast, and within minutes you’ll find yourself quickly unmotivated to touch any of them. And the worst thing is the game punishes you for not doing that. Upon starting the game the first thing they tell you is that combat don\\'t give XP, but only completing achievements does. So you HAVE to do these tedious mobile game grinds to keep up with the ever increasing difficulty from progressing the main story.\"The forbidden forest is strictly off limits ... except for the dozens of poachers there roaming around like it\\'s some family picnic sites.\" But seriously though, why is there so many poachers in this game? It seems like for every 10 Hogwarts graduates, 8 of them choses poaching as their career.[b]The Combat[/b]Half the enemies have this weird coloured bubbles mechanics that requires you to pause the game mid-fight and switch between spells to break their shield before you can deal damage to them. The bubble shield mechanic looks great at first, but it quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating when the game starts throwing groups of 5~6 enemies at you at once, all with a different color of bubbles.And it\\'s even more frustrating that half the time when you cast a spell your character will cast it to the wrong target, meaning now you\\'re stuck running in circle for 15 seconds waiting for the spell to cooldown so that you may attempt to break their shields again.The game heavily synergize on reading enemies movement and countering their attacks using the correct spell, but it rarely becomes a reality when 6 enemies are all throwing stuffs at you simultaneously, with half of them attacking from off-screen.1v1 however is a complete joke even on the hardest difficulty.  The combat offers no challenge when you have the full attention on a single enemy. You\\'ll have the luxury of time and correct casts to counter each and every of your enemy\\'s action. In fact I don\\'t recall myself losing to any of the 1v1 bosses fight.Or alternatively once you realize how powerful RB (RB is the button for throwing objects) is you can simply breaks the game by running in circles spamming RB and stones everyone to their death. Throwing object bypass most enemy mechanics, deals a great chunk of damage, while also giving you precious I-frames in battle. No need to care about your enemy\\'s shield or what they\\'re doing when you can just insta-kill them by pressing RB and fly some rocks into their faces. This is especially true once you learn the transformation spell and can turn smaller mobs into explosive barrels, effectively taking out 2 enemies in each fight before the combat music even starts to play.[b]The Story[/b] [i] This section contains spoilers [/i]Absolute dogshit logic everywhere. Professor Fig can Reparo a bridge but not a book with a few missing pages. [spoiler]Sebastian revealing unforgivable curses for no apparently reasons, when other spells can work just fine in his situation. [/spoiler]Poaching is bad ... unless it\\'s you doing it, than you have the full support from Hogwarts. Doing harm against a Unicorn is a crime against humanity, but when you lock them up in a virtual world and harvest their horns every 20 minutes it is \"20 points for ravenclaws\". It baffles me a lot when professor Weasley asked me to treat Deek with respect, as she and Deek has been working together for a very long time, yet all she can spare Deek is some dirty ragcloth to wear. In fact, all house-elf working in Hogwarts still dresses like a slave with no explaination. Despite everyone is worried about the goblin invasion nobody seems to be doing anything about it. The world is seemingly dead and you\\'re the only person alive trying to stop the goblins. There\\'s just something special about Skyrim where there\\'re city guards patrolling down the main roads and even setting up sentry camps on hills and chokepoints, and you can occasionally sees them slaying wolves and bandits to keep the road safe. The roads in Hogwarts however is just poachers, and goblins, and spiders. But mostly just poachers.[spoiler]The four keepers still trying to withholding information from you and put you up for their trials, even after you\\'ve told them some goblin already digged into THEIR legacy and using THEIR power to threaten the world. It makes absolutely zero senses that the keepers would throttle you by withholding information and requires you to work for it, when fundamentally speaking the entire goblin situation is their fucked up and you\\'re just there to clean up their messes.[/spoiler]LACREME DE LACREMEI became a wizard, good gameiM a wIzArdThis Game is fully Amazing and the game play is very goodAn amazing RPG! It has spells, great combat, awesome story line and much to explore. For a first of its kind Wizarding game, 10/10.Absolutely Amazing!!!! well done game put together really well.

Probably the best single-player I\\'ve touched in years. I\\'m confident enough to say this is GOTY.I bought it because of pure spite, and I\\'ll do it again :PFinally, a Harry Potter game that fans can be grateful for, and doesn\\'t feel like a cash grab by the creatorsSebastian is a homie for life we run so Voldemort can sprint Sebastian is the homieIt has wands and shit like total like the best gAME EVERi would have sexual intercourse with this gameits wingardium leviosuhhhhhhhhhhhhGreat gameGreat gamei like this gameNeeds some perfomance fixes for PC but truly a fantastic game..The game of the decadeCat lovers, rejoice.

Story is decently compelling. Combat not too shabby. Made my wand stiff.very fun wizard game wow wow wow abra cadabraA polished game for once. UwUBEST GAME OUT RIGHT NOW! IT EVEN WORKS FOR THE STEAM DECK! A+++it really feels like harry potter solid gameI used to have to get belligerently stoned to visit hogwarts!! Now I only have to press \"Play\"!!! (still getting stoned though..so good so goodspent a hour on my guy just to have a npc be a exact twin of my guy 10-10 game besides evil london loser twinNever thought i would like a game about casting magic but im hooked. it has performance issues, but if you got a good rig its pretty fun to play.Great for collectors and completionists. Needs a few minor tweaks for optimization but it\\'s fun/its wizard timeGood gamenot harry potter with out HagridCrucio + Killing Curse goes crazyIts Greatgood game, you should playLets start this off by saying Hogwarts legacy is a beautiful game, its storytelling and environments are amazing.But...This game is an absolute mess.Just to begin with the fps drops and stuttering are nearly constant often causing the fights to be impossible to complete until the game fixes itself up, for however long that is. A re-occurring bug that caused the player to lock onto an enemy or object, while the camera would continue to spin the opposite direction, in turn this making the character roll in the wrong direction or just straight up shoot at nothing.I wouldn\\'t be able to count on two hands the amount of times i was killed by a troll completely ignoring the long dash i do and just appear on top of me doing an attack (not a teleport, just straight up sliding across the floor at light speed towards the character), this wasn\\'t exclusive to trolls just more frequent.While not as common as the other problems i found myself getting stuck inside objects frequently. In often cases walls that i should\\'ve been able to scale or climb just wouldn\\'t work, yet i would come back 10 maybe 5 minutes later and i could climb said spot without any issues.But with all of that i still very much enjoyed the game and would\\'ve given it a positive review, until of course i load into the game and am introduced to a settings screen, the kind you get at the start of the game. All of my past files (18 hours of game play) were gone, and then magically the game crashes causing the cloud save to update. Now whether its normal for the steam cloud to delete past saves to clear up space or not i can\\'t deal with the fact that i have to redo all of the stuff i had done before.I\\'ve requested a refund but don\\'t honestly think ill get it.avada kedavraThis has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time.  Its just behind Skyrim for me.  Absolutely would recommend playing with minimap disabled.Great game, most fun Ive had in a long time.It\\'s like a place out of a story book.WOAHHHH DUDE, I LOVE DOING SPELLS, I WISH I COULD DO SPELLS IN REAL LIFE, I WOULD DO A SPELL ON MY MUM TO STOP HER FROM GOING TO THE POKIES AND ID DEFINITELY DO A SPELL TO GET MY STEP DAD PUT IN JAIL!!! take that muggles.. hehwizard gamebrings back a lot of nostalgia from watching the movies growing up. Makes my childhood wish of being in hogwarts just a lil bit more real. great game and im very happy with this purchasei love magic and menFRICK YOU SJWThe game is poorly optimized, sluggish and suffers from constant stutters. Even with the day 1 patch, the game struggles to maintain 60 fps within the recommended developer specs.laggy for a bit until it smooths put, definitely worth it thorowling very bad. game very good. pretty simpleAAAAVAAADDDDAAAAGREAT GAME!!!!!!!Never was into the Harry Potter universe. This game changed that. Absolutely fantastic. Feels a bit like a never-ending tutorial, but its super fun regardless.pretty fun.. not that optimized, but playable and still enjoyable overall.. if you like simple stories, exploration and wielding spells/flying on brooms and beasts.. you\\'ll enjoy it.best rpg in a whileavada kedavragame so good i might rewatch the whole harry potter movies again !It’s Leviosa, Not Leviosaaa!dont be dumb ima wizard. 10/10fun, addicting, and magicima wizard. its coolWonderful gameIf you are on the younger side, or just really. really love Harry Potter, you will love this game.If you took the Harry Potter universe and it\\'s nostalgic charm out of this game, you\\'d be left with another generic open-world puzzle game with an emphasis on collecting hidden items and completing quests where you find 50/50 of some hidden item. The story is bland and generic with no permanent effect on the wider Harry Potter world. Combat is okay, spell combos can be fun and interesting, but the novelty quickly wears off. When there are lots of enemies you spend the entire time dodge rolling over and over in a less than perfect imitiation of Darksouls combat. The best part of getting a magical letter of acceptance to Hogwarts is the new world of freedom and possibility. The exploration in this game is just so structured and regimented that you lose most of that. They try and cover up that lack of freedom and possibility by keeping you busy with endless collection quests.The game is set in a totally new time period with all new characters, and we barely get to know any of them. Only three students have any sort of in depth relationship storyline, everyone else, including important faculty are just an empty robe or obvious archetypal gimmick. Just like when that stupid acceptance letter never showed up for me in real life; it\\'s just lost opportunity.Buy it if you can get it for basically free, or if you have small children who want to watch you play it.Absolutely beautiful game. Great mechanics, fun and addictive gameplay, lots of missions/quests/side-quests and all thrown together with a big-ol\\' hit of nostalgia! 10/10 would recommend!GOTY candidate easilyawesome.This game brings me back to my childhood and it\\'s so nice to be back in Harry Potter\\'s world.2023 best game awardGreat experienceits fun so farBest game ever.good so good the best game everAmazing world, much to explore plenty to get lost in \"To get lost is to learn the way\".Amazing, great story, amazing graphics and incredible open world. There is so much to do and to go.It\\'s fun.willy wigger10/10 crash simulatoranyone else getting crashes as he teleports u to the ground? i got more then enough needed system recommendations. is it a common thing happening atm or just a few?Miss.Garlic is that Granola chick I\\'ve been looking for.I can\\'t stop chumming!Worth the hype, the price and everything. Game\\'s a 9, a 10 if you ignore the multiple technical issues (i\\'m playing with a 3070ti and i7 10700k and I suffer some stuttering and frame drops).Game is fireoverall the game its goodI finished my PhD before this game was released. I AM LUCKYfun ass gameThis game is one of the best solo story games we\\'ve had in quite a bit! Also ur a fucking idiot if you don\\'t buy it. Stfu move on its a video game stop crying. Hope co-op comes in soon!Probably the best game I\\'ve ever played.GAME OF THE YEARA bit Gofetchy for my taste, but a lot of the puzzles and challenges are fairly innovative. Overall, a very enjoyable game.I was so excited to play just for my game not to work... Like i\\'ve try and checked everything and it just runs so slow and keep crashing and restarting my pc and ugh i hate it :(such a amazing game with great graphics and just awesome details.crazy game:thumb\\'sup:This game is badass.very enjoyable to playits amazing gameAmazing, stunning, beat all my expectations! definitely recommend this game.cool beansinsanely good if it runsThe open world of this game is unlike any other that I\\'ve experienced, it is exactly like I imagined an open world to be before I started playing gamesgood game, but some graphics bugs with face textures and body glitching, should be fixed eventualy.Im not sure how a mobile games developer made such an absolute banger of a game on the first effort. 10/10 would genocide poachers again.Because its good!3 Hours in and I bearly scratched the surface of this game, I love the graphics and the story has been amazing so far, I would definitely recommend this game, will add more to this review as I go alongI thought this game was going to be a disappointment based on pre-release videos, but when it got some good reviews I picked it up and I\\'m glad I did!  It\\'s a lot of fun - especially the combat!This game is all you wanted Hogwarts and Harry Potter to be!!! It\\'s a must buy if you are an avid Harry Potter fan! It is just remarkableHarry Potter cum simulatornot bad coming from someone who wasn\\'t really a harry potter fan in the first placeI haven\\'t had this much fun playing a game in a long time. Or maybe ever. I was skeptical, but this is truly magical. Just marvel in all the details.Just perfect!If this game ran a little bit better it would be in my top 10 favorite games, and I\\'ve only seen one harry potter movie and it was the 2nd to last oneIt\\'s AMAZINGGG!!wizard game goodStory is fine and all but that isn\\'t what I am here for. I am here for the magic and the gorgeous visuals followed by an above decent combat system that can get slightly repetitive quickly but it\\'s still somewhat addictingbest game ive ever played! 10 out of 10. I just hope its a game they add more to. i want multiplayer and DLC!!shadow money wizard gang, we luv casting spellsrertgrewterterwtSolid combatIf  you like story telling games this is it, filled with lots of stories and very minimal action, so take it how you want.its a great game!i love itAmazing gameplay though a little unoptimizedI\\'ve barely even scratched the surface and can already tell it\\'s going to be one of the best games I\\'ve ever played - even as someone who has only read the first two books. Absolutely everything you could want for a Harry Potter style game! Love the story and the combat using spells is one of my favorite parts of the game. If you\\'re a Harry Potter fan then I\\'d highly recommend playing this!Amazing!graphics are nice but combat is terribly clunky its a joke spell binds are just not practical on keyboard not at a fast pace at least also not really open world its more like a guided RPG i dont think anybody expected this to be a true open world game thoughAbsolutely awesome game!Love it! made me feel like the moviesAmazing! Lots of Exploration +100 hours of content available!It is so immersive, its like a combination of fallout, dragon age inquisition, skyrim, elden ring.AND WITH FLIGHT! 44 hours in And haven\\'t gotten bored of anything yet.Most fun game I played in a whileMy favorite open world game. It will most likely be 2023 game of the year.AVADA KEDAVRAI am 100% biased. But i also have ADHD and yet this game managed to capture my short-lived attention span for 45 hours and counting. I\\'ve just finished the game and I\\'m excited to go back at it again.fun combat, immersive world, good graphics, and a lot of things to dohighly recommendedjust ignore the fake dumbass haterswatch The Act Man vid and have a laughDon\\'t listen to all the idiotic politics; this is a great game. Graphics are stunning, combat is fun and engaging, puzzles and exploration galore. Truly feels magical. The character creation could be a bit more robust but that\\'s pretty minor.This game is peak'"
