# Intern Project

The function of open-response, user-entry question type in surveys can be difficult to understand, and often presents little actual utility. This project attempts to emphasize the practicality and encourage the use of open-ended questions in screeners and surveys by implementing common natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By utilizing modern data analysis software languages, particularly Python and R, I intend to replicate (but perhaps find nuance in) common Egg processes and better understand consumer preferences.
